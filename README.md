## Why this app?
I wrote this application because I wanted to experiment with technologies I haven't had a chance to use, specifically <b>Optical Character Recognition (OCR)</b>.  

I also wanted an application that I could use to track my spending while keeping the information local. The decision to use CSV files was made, as I wanted a file format that was easy to manipulate manually and transfer to different systems.
